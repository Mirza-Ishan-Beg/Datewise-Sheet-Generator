### DSG-V1.py

A automation program to generate Excel sheets with dedicated formulas and colors to make a Excel file that only requires data entries.

The focus of this project was to streamline a specific requirement for excel file generation that could allow more effective methods to enter data and not make inefficient self calculations for each situation.

The layout was planned out and the code has the template to generate embedded within the code itself, I.E. the program is a proof of concept for effective generation of the excel files that can be generated to make the process of data entry within excel sheets significantly faster and all the required calculation regions auto-completed by specific planned out formulas.

Now, a new version, which will be based on GUI to allow construction of the templates, is in progress.

_Note - "Template" here means a "date-wise table", where all dates should have similar dimensions of rows and columns._

### Simple Use-case

- The application was made to construct a rigorous, non-changing template structure.
- The GUI focuses on giving options to allow construction of flexible templates and templates that can be saved and loaded back up.
- You can still get the code for the DSG-V1.py from my GitHub as a proof of concept.
- The CLI menu will prompt my ASCII sir name and ask for year as an input, there you need to put the year for which you need to generate the sheet for.
